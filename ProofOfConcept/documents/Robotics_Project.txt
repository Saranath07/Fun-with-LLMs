Title: Robotics Project: Autonomous Drones for Agriculture

1. Introduction
The project focuses on the development of an autonomous drone system designed for agricultural use. The drones will monitor crop health, manage pesticide application, and improve overall farm productivity.

2. Scope
The drones will feature AI-based vision systems, GPS navigation, and real-time data analytics. They will autonomously survey large agricultural fields, identify crop issues, and optimize pesticide distribution.

3. Features
- GPS-based navigation
- Real-time data analytics
- AI-based crop health monitoring

4. Budget and Timeline
The project will cost $750,000 and will be completed in 9 months.

5. Conclusion
This autonomous drone system will significantly improve agricultural efficiency and reduce manual labor.
