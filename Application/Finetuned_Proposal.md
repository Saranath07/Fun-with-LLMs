To illustrate the predictive analytics system, we can use a mathematical model to describe the relationships between patient outcomes, medical history, and treatment plans. Let's consider a simple example using logistic regression:

Let $Y$ be the binary outcome variable (e.g., patient readmission), and let $X$ be the set of predictor variables (e.g., medical history, treatment plans). We can model the relationship between $Y$ and $X$ using logistic regression:

$$P(Y=1|X)=\frac{1}{1+e^{-\beta X}}$$

where $\beta$ is the set of model coefficients, and $e$ is the base of the natural logarithm.

We can estimate the model coefficients using maximum likelihood estimation:

$$\hat{\beta}=\arg\max_{\beta}L(\beta|X,Y)$$

where $L(\beta|X,Y)$ is the likelihood function.

Once we have estimated the model coefficients
